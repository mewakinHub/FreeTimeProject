## Nodejs Server: Event Loop
### Structure
The structure of an event loop is central to the functioning of asynchronous systems, particularly in environments like Node.js. An event loop allows for the concurrent execution of multiple tasks on a single thread. It's a key feature of event-driven and asynchronous programming models.
event-driven system:

1. **Single Thread**:
   - In event-driven systems, such as Node.js, there is typically a `single main thread` that executes the application's code. (JS code)
   - This single thread is responsible for `executing` JavaScript code and managing the event loop.
   - client send Request to/receive Response from Single Thread
   - checking whether "Is blocking I/O?" or not

2. **Event Queue**:
   - The event queue is a `data structure` that holds events or tasks that need to be processed. These events can be things like user input, network requests, timers, or other asynchronous operations.
   - The event queue follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, where the first event added is the first one to be processed.

3. **Blocking I/O**:
   - Blocking I/O refers to `synchronous Input/Output operations` that can block the execution of the main thread. For example, if your code makes a synchronous HTTP request, the thread will wait until the request is complete before moving on to the next task.
   - Connect to Database or not? / Use a Large process or not? (`Yes`: Internal Thread Pool),(`No`{such as normal math operation<no access to DB, not large process>}: Event Queue)

4. **Internal Thread Pool**:
   - In some cases, to mitigate the blocking nature of certain I/O operations, an event-driven system like Node.js might use an internal thread pool.
   - The internal thread pool consists of worker threads that can handle blocking I/O operations in parallel(Multi-thread), allowing the main thread to continue processing other events from the event queue.
   - This approach ensures that the main thread remains free to handle non-blocking tasks, maintaining system responsiveness.

2 scenarios:

- When an I/O operation is non-blocking (e.g., asynchronous file read), it is typically handled directly by the event loop without blocking the main thread. The event loop can continue processing other events while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
  - single thread [eg.)`setTimeout` or dbqueries function]

- When an I/O operation is blocking (e.g., synchronous database query), it can potentially block the main thread, which is not desirable in an event-driven system. To avoid this, some systems, like Node.js, use an `internal thread pool` to `offload` these blocking operations to worker threads, allowing the main thread to remain responsive to other tasks.
  - multi-thread

The decision of whether to use an internal thread pool or rely on the event queue for handling blocking I/O operations depends on the specific design and requirements of the system. It's a trade-off between resource utilization, system responsiveness, and scalability. Using an internal thread pool can be a good choice when the application needs to handle many concurrent connections and must remain responsive. However, managing worker threads adds complexity to the system, so it should be used judiciously.

In summary, the structure of an event loop, combined with decisions about handling blocking I/O, is crucial for creating efficient and responsive event-driven systems.

### is blocking I/O ?
The decision of whether to use an internal thread pool or the event queue is primarily driven by whether the I/O operations are blocking or non-blocking, and this decision is related to the behavior of the main single thread.

Here's the key relationship:

1. **Blocking I/O**:
   - When you have blocking I/O operations in your code, meaning they pause the execution of the main single thread until the I/O operation completes, this can lead to decreased system responsiveness.
   - To mitigate this, you would typically use an internal thread pool to offload these blocking I/O operations to separate worker threads, allowing the main thread to continue processing other tasks from the event queue.
   - Using an internal thread pool in this context helps maintain system responsiveness and throughput.

2. **Non-blocking I/O**:
   - Non-blocking I/O operations do not block the main single thread. Instead, they allow the main thread to continue processing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
   - In this case, the event queue alone can handle the I/O operations efficiently.

So, whether to use an internal thread pool or rely solely on the event queue depends on the blocking behavior of I/O operations. When the I/O operations are non-blocking, the event queue can suffice. When I/O operations are blocking, it's advisable to use an internal thread pool to prevent the main thread from being blocked, ensuring system responsiveness.

The primary goal is to keep the main thread available to handle non-blocking tasks and ensure that the event loop continues to process events without interruptions, even in the presence of blocking I/O operations.

### distinction between asynchronous file I/O and synchronous operations, along with an example:

1. **Asynchronous File I/O:** I've chosen to use `setInterval` for handling asynchronous file I/O operations. This approach is well-suited for tasks like writing data to a file at regular intervals without blocking the event loop.

2. **Non-Blocking Advantage:** The use of `setInterval` ensures that these file I/O operations don't block other asynchronous tasks, allowing them to proceed in parallel.

3. **Consideration for Synchronous Tasks:** If the scenario involved synchronous operations or required different looping conditions, a `while` loop might have been a more appropriate choice.

**Example:** Think of a situation where you need to periodically log system data to a file. Using `setInterval` in this case ensures uninterrupted system monitoring without hindering other processes.

Async(Non blocking I/O) go to LibUV for [executing??], then go to event queue for queuing to callback like other normal function in  V8 engine [call stack)

- But Normal V8 engine[call stack tracks execution of function in main thread] running is from above to the below line, but if found fn. Itâ€™s have to put it into LibUV first before go to the next one

### NEED TO MAKE HANDS-ON PROJECT FOR REAL UNDERSTANDING!!!!

The V8 engine is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used primarily in Google Chrome and Node.js, but it can also be embedded in other applications.

Key features and characteristics of the V8 engine include:

1. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: V8 uses a Just-In-Time compiler to translate JavaScript code into optimized machine code, which improves the execution speed of JavaScript programs.
2. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**: V8 is single-threaded and uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations, which allows it to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.
3. **Memory Management**: V8 employs a garbage collector to manage memory allocation and deallocation for JavaScript objects. It automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
4. **ECMAScript Compatibility**: V8 adheres to the ECMAScript standards, making it compatible with JavaScript specifications and ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
5. **Embeddable**: V8 can be embedded in other C++ applications, allowing developers to extend applications with JavaScript scripting capabilities.
6. **Optimizations**: V8 applies various optimizations to JavaScript code, including inlining functions, optimizing property access, and using hidden classes to improve performance.
7. **Node.js Integration**: V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js, making it a popular choice for building scalable server-side applications.
8. **Open Source**: V8 is open-source, and its development is driven by contributions from the open-source community.

V8's speed and efficiency are attributed to its innovative design and continuous optimization. It has played a significant role in the performance improvements seen in modern web browsers and server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js. The engine's ability to efficiently execute JavaScript code has made it a critical component in the success of web applications and the adoption of server-side JavaScript.
