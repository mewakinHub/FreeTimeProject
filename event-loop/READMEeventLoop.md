## Nodejs Server: Event Loop
### Structure
The structure of an event loop is central to the functioning of asynchronous systems, particularly in environments like Node.js. An event loop allows for the concurrent execution of multiple tasks on a single thread. It's a key feature of event-driven and asynchronous programming models.
event-driven system:

1. **Single Thread**:
   - In event-driven systems, such as Node.js, there is typically a `single main thread` that executes the application's code. (JS code)
   - This single thread is responsible for `executing` JavaScript code and managing the event loop.
   - client send Request to/receive Response from Single Thread
   - checking whether "Is blocking I/O?" or not

2. **Event Queue**:
   - The event queue is a `data structure` that holds events or tasks that need to be processed. These events can be things like user input, network requests, timers, or other asynchronous operations.
   - The event queue follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, where the first event added is the first one to be processed.

3. **Blocking I/O**:
   - Blocking I/O refers to `synchronous Input/Output operations` that can block the execution of the main thread. For example, if your code makes a synchronous HTTP request, the thread will wait until the request is complete before moving on to the next task.
   - Connect to Database or not? / Use a Large process or not? (`Yes`: Internal Thread Pool),(`No`{such as normal math operation<no access to DB, not large process>}: Event Queue)

4. **Internal Thread Pool**:
   - In some cases, to mitigate the blocking nature of certain I/O operations, an event-driven system like Node.js might use an internal thread pool.
   - The internal thread pool consists of worker threads that can handle blocking I/O operations in parallel(Multi-thread), allowing the main thread to continue processing other events from the event queue.
   - This approach ensures that the main thread remains free to handle non-blocking tasks, maintaining system responsiveness.

The decision of whether to use an internal thread pool or rely on the event queue for handling blocking I/O operations depends on the specific design and requirements of the system. It's a trade-off between resource utilization, system responsiveness, and scalability. Using an internal thread pool can be a good choice when the application needs to handle many concurrent connections and must remain responsive. However, managing worker threads adds complexity to the system, so it should be used judiciously.

In summary, the structure of an event loop, combined with decisions about handling blocking I/O, is crucial for creating efficient and responsive event-driven systems.

### *blocking I/O operation*
Blocking I/O operations can indeed block the main thread and the event loop. Let me clarify this in more detail:

1. **Blocking the Main Thread**: When a blocking I/O operation occurs, it prevents the main thread from executing any other code. It halts the execution of JavaScript on the main thread, causing it to wait until the I/O operation is complete.

2. **Blocking the Event Loop**: The event loop in Node.js is responsible for handling asynchronous operations. When a blocking I/O operation is executed synchronously, it blocks the event loop as well because the event loop is unable to process other tasks while waiting for the blocking operation to finish.

So, if you execute a blocking I/O operation directly on the main thread in a Node.js application, it can block both the main thread and the event loop, leading to decreased responsiveness and concurrency. This can be problematic in applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently.

To address this, you can use asynchronous methods and non-blocking I/O. Instead of running the I/O operation synchronously, you can use `asynchronous` methods that allow the main thread and the event loop to continue processing other tasks while the I/O operation runs in the background. When the I/O operation is complete, its callback is placed in the event queue, and the event loop handles it, ensuring that the main thread remains non-blocking and responsive.

However, in some cases, you might have legacy code or situations where you must work with blocking I/O operations. In these cases, using an `internal thread pool` can help offload the blocking operation to a separate thread, ensuring that the main thread and event loop remain responsive. This is a way to mitigate the blocking nature of certain operations, even when they must be executed synchronously.

### distinction between asynchronous file I/O and synchronous operations, along with an example:

1. **Asynchronous File I/O:** I've chosen to use `setInterval` for handling asynchronous file I/O operations. This approach is well-suited for tasks like writing data to a file at regular intervals without blocking the event loop.

2. **Non-Blocking Advantage:** The use of `setInterval` ensures that these file I/O operations don't block other asynchronous tasks, allowing them to proceed in parallel.

3. **Consideration for Synchronous Tasks:** If the scenario involved synchronous operations or required different looping conditions, a `while` loop might have been a more appropriate choice.

**Example:** Think of a situation where you need to periodically log system data to a file. Using `setInterval` in this case ensures uninterrupted system monitoring without hindering other processes.

- Async(blocking I/O) go to LibUV for [executing], then go to event queue for queuing to callback like other normal function in  V8 engine [call stack]

- But Normal V8 engine[call stack tracks execution of function in main thread] running is from above to the below line, but if it finding blocking I/O op. Itâ€™s have to put it into LibUV first before go to the next one 

#### how main single thread of JS enginer belike:

The V8 engine is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used primarily in Google Chrome and Node.js, but it can also be embedded in other applications.

Key features and characteristics of the V8 engine include:

1. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: V8 uses a Just-In-Time compiler to translate JavaScript code into optimized machine code, which improves the execution speed of JavaScript programs.
2. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**: V8 is single-threaded and uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations, which allows it to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.
3. **Memory Management**: V8 employs a garbage collector to manage memory allocation and deallocation for JavaScript objects. It automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
4. **ECMAScript Compatibility**: V8 adheres to the ECMAScript standards, making it compatible with JavaScript specifications and ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
5. **Embeddable**: V8 can be embedded in other C++ applications, allowing developers to extend applications with JavaScript scripting capabilities.
6. **Optimizations**: V8 applies various optimizations to JavaScript code, including inlining functions, optimizing property access, and using hidden classes to improve performance.
7. **Node.js Integration**: V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js, making it a popular choice for building scalable server-side applications.
8. **Open Source**: V8 is open-source, and its development is driven by contributions from the open-source community.

V8's speed and efficiency are attributed to its innovative design and continuous optimization. It has played a significant role in the performance improvements seen in modern web browsers and server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js. The engine's ability to efficiently execute JavaScript code has made it a critical component in the success of web applications and the adoption of server-side JavaScript.
