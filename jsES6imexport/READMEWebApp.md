# React.js & Node.js in HTTP protocols

In a typical web application architecture, React.js is used on the client side to make requests to the server, and Node.js (often with the help of a web framework like Express.js) is used on the server side to receive those requests, process them, and respond to them, including interacting with a database if necessary. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Client Side (React.js)**:
   - React.js runs in the user's web browser and handles the user interface and user interactions.
   - When the user interacts with the application, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, React.js can make HTTP requests to the server to retrieve or send data.
   - These requests are typically in the form of API calls, which can be used to read or write data from and to a database or perform other actions.

2. **Server Side (Node.js with Express.js)**: 
   - Node.js, often with the help of a web framework like Express.js, runs on the server and listens for incoming requests.
   - When a request is received, the server processes it. This processing can involve various tasks, such as authentication, data validation, and interaction with a database.
   - The server sends a response back to the client, typically in the form of data, which React.js can use to update the user interface.
   - backend  

3. **Database Interaction**:
   - If the application requires database interaction, the server (Node.js) can communicate with the database to retrieve or store data. This is done using database-specific libraries or ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) in Node.js.

In this architecture, React.js focuses on providing a smooth and interactive user interface, while Node.js, along with Express.js, handles server-side tasks, including receiving requests, processing them, interacting with databases, and sending responses back to the client. This separation of responsibilities between the client and server helps create scalable and maintainable web applications.

## CMS in this system

In the structure you've described, the CMS (Content Management System) typically plays a role in managing and creating content for the website or web application. It's a separate component that often interacts with both the client-side (React.js) and the server-side (Node.js with Express.js). Here's how the CMS fits into the picture:

1. **Content Management System (CMS)**:
   - The CMS is a software application or platform used for creating, managing, and organizing digital content. This content can include text, images, videos, and other resources.
   - Content creators and administrators use the CMS to add, edit, and organize content, and they can often do this through a web-based interface.

2. **Client Side (React.js)**:
   - React.js is responsible for rendering and displaying content on the user interface. In many cases, the content displayed in React.js is retrieved from the server (Node.js) via API calls.
   - The CMS can also provide APIs or feeds that React.js can use to fetch and display content. These APIs can deliver content to the client for rendering.

3. **Server Side (Node.js with Express.js)**:
   - The server-side code (Node.js with Express.js) is responsible for handling requests made by the client (React.js).
   - If the content displayed on the website or application comes from a CMS, the server may have to interact with the CMS to fetch the requested content. This interaction might be in the form of API requests to the CMS.

So, the CMS is a critical part of the content creation and management process. Content creators use the CMS to manage the website's content, and the server (Node.js) may interact with the CMS to retrieve content to serve to the client (React.js). The CMS's role is to simplify content management and ensure that the most up-to-date and relevant content is displayed to users.
